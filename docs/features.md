# Features

Here's an overview of AddyScript's main features:

* C-like syntax with notable borrowings from popular scripting languages ​​like JavaScript, PHP, Python, and Ruby.

    **Note**: AddyScript is however more influenced by C# than by any other language.

* Dynamic typing (variables are declared when assigned a value and can change type during script execution).
* Literals for most primitive types (including dates).
* Initializers for most composite types (complex numbers, collections, and objects).
* Functions accept parameters passed to them by reference or as a variable-length argument list.
* Support for object-oriented programming with encapsulated properties, events, operator overloading, and introspection.
* Closures and lambda expressions.
* Tight integration with the .Net platform.
* Support for interoperability with COM (on Windows).
* Structured handling of runtime errors.
* Ability to import one script from another.
* Ability to pass initial parameters to a script and retrieve them after execution.
* Ability to extend the scripting engine by providing new functions or "built-in" classes.
* The entire scripting engine is exposed as a class library to the .Net platform.
* Availability of a graphical script editor and an interactive console for testing scripts.
