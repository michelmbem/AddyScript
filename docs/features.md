# Features
Here is an overview of AddyScript's main features: 
 * C-like syntax with noticeable loans to popular scripting languages like JavaScript, PHP, Python and Ruby.  
 * Dynamic typing (variables are declared just as they are assigned a value and may change their type at runtime).  
 * Literals for most primitive types (including dates).  
* Initializers for most composite types (complex numbers, collections and objects).  
 * Functions accept parameters passed to them by reference or as variably sized list of arguments.  
 * OOP support with properties, events, operator overloading and introspection.  
 * Closures and lambda expressions.  
 * Tight integration to the .Net and Mono platforms.  
 * Support of COM interoperability (on Windows).  
 * Exceptions handling.  
 * Ability to import a script from another one.  
 * Ability to pass initial parameters to a script and to retrieve them upon completion.  
 * Ability to extend the scripting engine by providing custom 'built-in' functions or classes.  
 * The whole scripting engine is exposed as an API to the .Net and Mono platforms.  
 * Availability of a graphical script editor and an interactive console for testing scripts.
