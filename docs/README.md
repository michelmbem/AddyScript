# Welcome to AddyScript

AddyScript is a lightweight scripting engine for the .NET platform. It can be used to add scripting functionality to applications targeting this platform or simply as a learning tool for young people.

AddyScript has a simple syntax, similar to that of C (or JavaScript or PHP, depending on your preference), with dynamic typing and consistent object-oriented programming features. You can familiarize yourself with this syntax by reviewing the example scripts provided with the source code.

This manual aims to guide you through its syntax and features.
