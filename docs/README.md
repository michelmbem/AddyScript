# Welcome to AddyScript

AddyScript is a lightweight scripting engine for the .Net platform. It can be used to add scripting features to applications that target that platform or simply as a learning tool for young people.

AddyScript has a simple C-like syntax (or JavaScript-like or PHP-like if you prefer) with dynamic typing and consistent OOP features. You can learn about this syntax by looking at the sample scripts provided with the source code.
