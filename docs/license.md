# Licensing

Versions of AddyScript prior to 0.9.9 were published under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).
The source-code was then shared on CodePlex (now archived).

Since version 0.9.9, AddyScript is licensed under the [MIT License](https://mit-license.org/).

This essentially means that you are still free to use or modify AddyScript in any project, whether it is commercial or not,
open-source or not, at no cost without being obliged to provide your source-code.

However I would be very pleased if you mention in your project (or one of its relative content)
that part (or the whole) of your work derives from AddyScript.
