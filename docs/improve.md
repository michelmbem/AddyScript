# Improving the scripting engine

There is still a lot of missing functionalities in AddyScript.
If you have an idea about how to implement them, please just join the project at [GitHub](https://github.com/michelmbem/AddyScript) or contact the [original author](mailto:/michel.mbem@gmail.com).
All contributions are honestly welcome; even sending me (us?) the feedback of your experience with AddyScript is a huge contribution.
